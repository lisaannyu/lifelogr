# 5. Experimentation framework. The package will provide the framework for a user 
# to easily perform A/B or other testing on him/herself - for example, decide 
# he/she wants to know if his/her heart rate is higher in a statistically 
# significant way when alcohol or caffeine is consumed, and so mark each day/time 
# of consumption, then display the results of hypothesis testing on the desired field.
