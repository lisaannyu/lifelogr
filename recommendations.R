# 4. Recommendations for improvement. Based on a user's choice of goal, we can 
# recommend strategies based on their data (for example, if a user walks a lot on 
# the weekdays but not weekends and is not meeting their target step count, 
# suggest walks on the weekends, at times of day when they are usually active on 
# the weekdays according to their heart rate).
